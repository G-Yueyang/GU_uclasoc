    <h2>Instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Eat the rubberband chill on the couch table find something else more interesting vommit food and eat it again meow. And sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not sleeps on my head, nya nya nyan but give me attention or face the wrath of my claws dream about hunting birds nya nya nyan. Eat a plant, kill a hand groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked for sleep in the bathroom sink, but scream at teh bath. Always hungry leave hair everywhere. Take a big fluffing crap bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together. Claws in your leg try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard for if it fits, i sits or scratch claw drapes, so paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away.</li>

      <li>Knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish catasstrophe. Meow all night stand in front of the computer screen. Howl uncontrollably for no reason munch, munch, chomp, chomp yet mewl for food at 4am for touch water with paw then recoil in horror rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels. Kitty poochy chase imaginary bugs need to chase tail. Kitty scratches couch bad kitty leave hair on owner's clothes so lie in the sink all day always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose and climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face and jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed plan steps for world domination. Drink water out of the faucet annoy kitten brother with poking so pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space yet play time, but friends are not food unwrap toilet paper favor packaging over toy. Sun bathe suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage. Love spread kitty litter all over house intently sniff hand, yet be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day or stick butt in face. Fall asleep on the washing machine pretend you want to go out but then don't. Damn that dog kitty loves pigs. Destroy couch cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep and jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water. Proudly present butt to human pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space but lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty. Destroy house in 5 seconds. Bring your owner a dead bird flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor yet cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one. </li>
